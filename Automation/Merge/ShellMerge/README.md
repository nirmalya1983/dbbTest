## Shell Merge Sample

This is a sample to demonstrate how to use the Z Open Automation Utilities shell commands to merge two datasets.

The sample creates two datasets to merge, a command dataset, and a merge dataset that contains the output from the sort command.
mvscmd is then used to call the sort command to sort and merge the two datasets together.

One must modify the setenv.sh file with the appropriate values for your installation of Java and your installation of Z Open Automation Utilities before running this sample.

Run `merge.sh -?` for information about program parameters.
